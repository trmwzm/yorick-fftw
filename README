README for yorick-fftw yorick FFTW3 plug-in
===========================================

See http://dhmunro.github.com/yorick-doc and http://fftw.org .

yorick-fftw is a compiled yorick plug-in for FFTW3.  It attempts to replicate
yorick's built-in fft functionality, with an added  capability for computing
FFTs of type float-complex, which are  here represented in yorick as float 
array with a leading length-2  dimension. 

INSTALLATION

yorick -batch make.i
make check
make install

The FFTW3 shared library must be compiled, and wisdom files available, for both
double-complex and float-complex types.  Flags [PKG_DEPLIBS, PKG_CFLAGS] must 
be set in the Makefile generated by "yorick -batch make.i" if needed.  The path 
to FFTW3 wisdom files (both float and double) or to yorick-specific copies of 
those files, must be set in yfftw.i (see FFTW[F]_WISDOM_FNM.)
